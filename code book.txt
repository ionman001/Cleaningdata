
Below are the coloumns used in the final table of the submitted code

These features were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ: body acceleration on X,Y,Z axis. unit(m/s2)
tGravityAcc-XYZ: Gravitational acceleration on X,Y,Z axis. unit(m/s2)
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ : body acceleration due to jerk on X,Y,Z axis. unit(m/s2)
tBodyGyro-XYZ : body gyroscope reading on X,Y,Z axis. unit(rad/s)
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ : : body gyroscope due to jerk reading on X,Y,Z axis. unit(rad/s)
tBodyAccMag: Total magnitude of acceleration unit(m/s2)
tGravityAccMag: Total magnitude of gravity acceleration. unit(m/s2)
tBodyAccJerkMag: total body acceleration due to jerk unit(m/s2)
tBodyGyroMag: Total body gyroscope maginitude  unit(rad/s)
tBodyGyroJerkMag Total body gyroscope maginitude due to jerk  unit(rad/s)
fBodyAcc-XYZ body acceleration on X,Y,Z axis. unit(m/s2)
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ  acceleration on X,Y,Z axis due to jerk. unit(m/s2)
fBodyGyro-XYZ body acceleration due to jerk on X,Y,Z axis. unit(m/s2)
fBodyGyro-XYZ : body gyroscope reading on X,Y,Z axis. unit(rad/s)
fBodyGyroJerk-XYZ : : body gyroscope due to jerk reading on X,Y,Z axis. unit(rad/s)
tBodyAccMag: Total magnitude of acceleration unit(m/s2)
tGravityAccMag: Total magnitude of gravity acceleration. unit(m/s2)
tBodyAccJerkMag: total body acceleration due to jerk unit(m/s2)

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

subject_ID : Unique number that differetiates between the subjects i.e the people on which the experiment was carrired out.
Activity_type: It describes the activity of the users during which the experiment was carried out.
